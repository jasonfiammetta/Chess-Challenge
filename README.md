# Chess Coding Challenge (C#)
Welcome to the [chess coding challenge](https://youtu.be/iScy18pVR58)! This is a friendly competition in which your goal is to create a small chess bot (in C#) using the framework provided in this repository.

This is my entry to the competition, to see rules and explanation, please see the original forked repository [here](https://github.com/SebLague/Chess-Challenge)

Thanks to Sebastian Lague for running this challenge!

## Bot Brain Capacity
There is a size limit on the code you create called the _bot brain capacity_. This is measured in ‘tokens’ and may not exceed 1024. The number of tokens you have used so far is displayed on the bottom of the screen when running the program.

All names (variables, functions, etc.) are counted as a single token, regardless of length. This means that both lines of code: `bool a = true;` and `bool myObscenelyLongVariableName = true;` count the same. Additionally, the following things do not count towards the limit: white space, new lines, comments, access modifiers, commas, and semicolons.
